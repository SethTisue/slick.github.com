title: Commercial and Open Source licensing for Slick
author: Stefan Zeiger
---
With the release of Slick 2.0 we will be streamlining the licensing model for the Slick drivers that are supported by Typesafe. We are going to offer drivers for proprietary database systems as part of the [Typesafe Subscription](http://typesafe.com/how/subscription) in the closed source Slick Extensions package. Open source database systems will generally be supported by open source drivers that are released as part of the Slick core project. As a consequence of this policy, the Slick driver for Microsoft SQL Server will be moved from Slick to Slick Extensions shortly before the first release candidate for Slick 2.0 is cut.

We understand that this may be an undue burden for people who are currently using Slick with the SQL Server driver in production, so we are offering free licenses in these cases. If you are affected by this, please [contact us](mailto:info@typesafe.com) no later than June 30th 2013.
