title: Slick 2.0.0-M3
author: Stefan Zeiger
---
We have just released Slick 2.0.0-M3, the third milestone for Slick 2.0. It
should show up on Maven Central within the next few hours. You can find the
source code here: https://github.com/slick/slick/tree/2.0.0-M3. Please see
http://slick.typesafe.com/docs/ for documentation.

We published
M2 in July but it was never officially announced and did not come with updated
documentation, so these release notes include the changes for both, M2 and M3.

##### These are the major new features added since M1:

* Table definitions in the Lifted Embedding use a new syntax which is slightly
  more verbose but also more robust and logical, avoiding several pitfalls from
  earlier versions.

* Table definitions (and their `*` projections) are not restricted to flat
  tuples of columns anymore. They can use any type that would be valid as the
  return type of a Query. The old projection concatenation methods `~` and `~:`
  are still supported but not imported by default.

* In addition to Scala tuples, Slick supports its own `HList` abstraction for
  records of arbitrary size. You can also add support for your own record types
  with only a few lines of code. All record types can be used everywhere
  (including table definitions and mapped projections) and they can be mixed
  and nested arbitrarily.

* Some changes to the API to bring it closer to Scala Collections syntax.

* `threadLocalSession` has been renamed to `dynamicSession` and the corresponding
  methods have distinct names (e.g. `withDynSession` vs the standard `withSession`).
  This allows the use of the standard methods without extra type annotations.
  Thread-local sessions are not deprecated but we want to push explicit session
  management (with the now simpler syntax) as the default.

* Some important parts of the query compiler have been rewritten. Column flattening
  and the emulation of `Boolean` which is required by some databases should now be
  more robust.

* Soft inserts are now the default, i.e. `AutoInc` columns are automatically skipped
  when inserting with `+=`, `++=`, `insert` and `insertAll`. This means that you no
  longer need separate projections (without the primary key) for inserts.
  There are separate methods `forceInsert` and `forceInsertAll` in `JdbcProfile` for
  the old behavior.

* A new model for pre-compiled queries replaces the old `QueryTemplate` abstraction.
  Any query (both, actual collection-valued `Query` objects and scalar queries) or
  function from `Column` types to such a query can now be lifted into a `Compiled`
  wrapper. Lifted functions can be applied (without having to recompile the query),
  and you can use both monadic composition of `Compiled` values or just get the
  underlying query and use that for further composition.

Note that this is not a production-ready or beta release. The Slick Extensions
package is not available for this milestone release and the
[Slick Examples](https://github.com/slick/slick-examples)
and [Slick Testkit Example](https://github.com/slick/slick-testkit-example)
projects have not been updated yet.

We expect that the next published version of Slick will be 2.0.0-RC1 which will integrate code-generator-based type providers and add more documentation and bug fixes. It will
also come with an updated Slick Extensions package.
