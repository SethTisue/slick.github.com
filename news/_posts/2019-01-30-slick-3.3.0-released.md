## Migration 

### Create / Drop If Not Exists

There is no major changes in the API except for the addition of `createIfNotExists` and `dropIfExistsPhase`. This has only impact on database profile developers. Regular users are not impacted by it.

In other to support `createIfNotExists` and `dropIfExistsPhase`, the following changes were made:

* slick.jdbc.JdbcStatementBuilderComponent#TableDDLBuilder.createTable receives not a `checkNotExists: Boolean` as argument
* slick.jdbc.JdbcStatementBuilderComponent#TableDDLBuilder.dropTable receives not a `ifExists: Boolean` as argument
* slick.sql.SqlProfile#DDL.apply has two more arguments `createIfNotExists: Iterable[String]` and `dropIfExists: Iterable[String]`
