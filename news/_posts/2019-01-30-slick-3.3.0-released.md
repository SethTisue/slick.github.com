## Migration 

### Create / Drop If Not Exists

There is no major changes in the API except for the addition of `createIfNotExists` and `dropIfExistsPhase`. This has only impact on database profile developers. Regular users are not impacted by it.

In other to support `createIfNotExists` and `dropIfExistsPhase`, the following changes were made:

* slick.jdbc.JdbcStatementBuilderComponent#TableDDLBuilder.createTable receives not a `checkNotExists: Boolean` as argument
* slick.jdbc.JdbcStatementBuilderComponent#TableDDLBuilder.dropTable receives not a `ifExists: Boolean` as argument
* slick.sql.SqlProfile#DDL.apply has two more arguments `createIfNotExists: Iterable[String]` and `dropIfExists: Iterable[String]`

### Support for `java.time` columns

[time-upgrade]: https://github.com/slick/slick/blob/28094bf669656cbe8578387827a0b145a43de192/doc/src/upgrade.md#support-for-javatime-columns

If you used custom mappings for `java.time` types before Slick 3.3.0,
please [review the default mappings][time-upgrade] now used by Slick 3.3.0.

The Slick 3.3.0 mappings take precedence over any `MappedColumnType`s you may have defined for the `java.time` columns. 
The [update guide][time-upgrade] provides additional information.
