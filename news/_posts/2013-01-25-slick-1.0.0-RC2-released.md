title: Slick 1.0.0-RC2
author: Stefan Zeiger
---
We are happy to announce the release of Slick 1.0.0-RC2 for Scala 2.10.0. All
artifacts are available from Maven Central. You can find the
source code here: https://github.com/slick/slick/tree/1.0.0-RC2.
The documentation for this release is located at
http://slick.typesafe.com/doc/1.0.0-RC2/.

This is the second release candidate for Slick 1.0.0, with some bug fixes,
improved documentation and new test cases on top of RC1. If no critical
bugs are discovered in RC2, we expect to release it as 1.0.0 final in two
weeks.

Note that the groupId for all Slick artifacts has changed between 1.0.0-RC1
and 1.0.0-RC2 from ``com.typesafe`` to ``com.typesafe.slick``. RC2 has also
been published under the old groupId with the appropriate relocation
information in the POM. Any new releases will only be published under
``com.typesafe.slick``.
