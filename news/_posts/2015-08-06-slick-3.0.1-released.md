We are happy to announce the release of Slick 3.0.1. The artifacts are available on Maven Central, as usual. You can find the source code here: <https://github.com/slick/slick/tree/3.0.1>. Please see <http://slick.typesafe.com/docs/> for documentation. This is a binary-compatible bugfix release.

##### Fixes and features:

* Update to HikariCP 2.3.7 (same version as used by play-slick)

* Allow custom ClassLoaders for loading driver classes

There is no new version of the [Slick Extensions](http://slick.typesafe.com/doc/3.0.1/extensions.html) package with closed-source drivers for Oracle, DB/2 and SQL Server for this release. Please continue using version 3.0.0.
