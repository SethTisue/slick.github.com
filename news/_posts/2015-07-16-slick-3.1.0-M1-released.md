title: Slick 3.1.0-M1
author: Stefan Zeiger
---
We have just released Slick 3.1.0-M1, the first milestone Slick. It
should show up on Maven Central within the next few hours. You can find the
source code here: <https://github.com/slick/slick/tree/3.1.0-M1>. Builds are
available for Scala 2.10 and 2.11.

##### These are the major new features in this miletone:

* New query compiler back-end. The main goal is to avoid subqueries wherever possible.
  The current version still has some limitations: It produces unnecessary subqueries for
  ``union`` and ``zip`` / ``zipWithIndex`` operations and there is no reordering of
  operations to get rid of subqueries arising from inefficient user code. It should be
  robust and stable enough to use though, and produce much better code than the old query
  compiler in many cases.
* Improved support for monadic joins in the query compiler. In particular, whenever a
  monadic join cannot be translated into an applicative join (as required for SQL), the
  query compiler will fail with a useful error message instead of producing invalid code.
* Improved configuration of database connections via Typesafe Config: You can now configure
  arbitrary DataSource classes with Java Bean semantics when running without a connection
  pool (similar to what was already supported by HikariCP).
* Configurable class loading when resolving Slick drivers: In containers which separate
  parts of an application into different ClassLoaders (e.g. Play, OSGi), the previous
  approach of using ``Class.forName`` did not work in all cases. You can now provide a
  custom ClassLoader, and Slick will fall back to the context ClassLoader in other cases.

Note that this is not a production-ready or beta release. Parts of the user manual may be
out of date. *Slick Extensions* is not available for this release and none of the standard
Activator templates have been updated yet.

Please provide feedback on the stability and API of this milestone release if you encounter any problems.
