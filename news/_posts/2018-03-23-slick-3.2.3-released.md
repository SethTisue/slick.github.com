We have just released Slick 3.2.3.
You can find the source code here: <https://github.com/slick/slick/tree/v3.2.3>.
Builds for Scala 2.11 and 2.12 are available from Maven Central, as usual.
From 3.2.0 on, Slick requires Java 8. Older JVMs are no longer supported.

This release contains only one fix and is intended to be binary compatible with 3.2.1.

* [``d713b9f``](https://github.com/slick/slick/commit/d713b9fff117e4fc962cc463bdd1cbfdc51c73f8) protects acquireSession call in a try / finally (#1877)

You can find details about upgrading from Slick 3.1 in the *Upgrade Guide*. 

The fix was provided by [Renato  Cavalcanti](https://github.com/renatocaval),
