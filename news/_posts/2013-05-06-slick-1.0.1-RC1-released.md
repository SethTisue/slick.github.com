We are happy to announce the release of Slick 1.0.1-RC1 for Scala 2.10. It
should show up on Maven Central within the next few hours. You can find the
source code here: <https://github.com/slick/slick/tree/1.0.1-RC1>.
The documentation for this release is located at <http://slick.typesafe.com/doc/1.0.1-RC1/>.

This is the first release candidate for Slick 1.0.1, a bug-fix release based
on 1.0.0. The public API of Slick 1.0.1 is forward and backward binary
compatible with Slick 1.0.0. If no regressions compared to Slick 1.0.0 are
discovered within the next two weeks, this release candidate will be
republished as release 1.0.1.

##### Slick Extensions

This release also comes with support for Oracle and DB2 database systems
through Typesafe's Slick Extensions package. You can find the binary and
scaladoc artifacts in the Typesafe repository:
<http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/maven-releases/com/typesafe/slick/>.
See the Slick documentation for further information. Note that
slick-extensions is not an open-source project. It is available under the
terms of the [Typesafe Subscription Agreement](http://typesafe.com/public/legal/TypesafeSubscriptionAgreement-v1.pdf)
which is also contained inside the main JAR.

There have been no changes to Slick Extensions since 1.0.0 was released, so we
are not publishing a new release. Please use Slick Extensions 1.0.0 together
with Slick 1.0.1-RC1.
