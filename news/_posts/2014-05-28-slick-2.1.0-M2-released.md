title: Slick 2.1.0-M2
author: Stefan Zeiger
---
We have just released Slick 2.1.0-M2, the second milestone for Slick 2.1. It
should show up on Maven Central within the next few hours. You can find the
source code here: <https://github.com/slick/slick/tree/2.1.0-M2>. Builds are
available for Scala 2.10 (2.10.4 recommended) and 2.11.

##### These are the major new features in this miletone:

* Insert-or-update support which makes use of native databases features where possible,
  falling back to a client-side emulation otherwise.
* Parameters for `take` and `drop` calls (required for pagination) can now be used in
  precompiled queries.
* Official support for Scala 2.11 releases.
* Configure database connections through Typesafe Config, in a format which is compatible
  with Play's database configuration (but no support for connection pools yet).
* New documentation in the user manual, including a chapter for migrating from SQL to Slick.
* TestKit is more flexible and easier to use. You can now use it to test your own
  extensions for Slick against the standard databases supported by Slick. Less
  configuration is required due to the use of Typesafe Config with sensible defaults.
* We don't use sample projects like `slick-examples` anymore. All samples come in the form
  of Activator templates with an integrated tutorial. They are tied to a Slick major
  version but evolve separately from minor releases.

Note that this is not a production-ready or beta release. In particular, the
manual has not yet been updated to reflect all the changes and new features (but
there are unit tests and scaladoc comments for them). The [Slick Extensions](http://slick.typesafe.com/doc/2.1.0-M2/extensions.html)
package has been published along with this milestone release. Please provide feedback on the stability and API of this
milestone release if you encounter any problems.
