I'd like to draw your attention to the new [community process](/community/process.html) and [code of conduct](/community/conduct.html) for Slick, both of which are based on [Play Framework's](https://playframework.com/community-process).

Back in 2008 [I](https://github.com/szeiger) started working on [ScalaQuery](http://scalaquery.org/). Several other people contributed code but I was the only committer and decision-maker. In 2011 [Typesafe](https://lightbend.com) adopted the ScalaQuery codebase for Slick and [Christopher Vogt](https://github.com/cvogt/) (working at [EPFL](http://lamp.epfl.ch/) at the time) became the second committer.

The number of 3rd-party contributors has increased quite a bit since then, and both Chris and I are only working part-time on Slick these days. To ensure the continuing success of the project we have invited a group of people from the Slick community to join us as maintainers, and set up an official [community process](/community/process.html) to make it easier for others to contribute to Slick. Since we operate under the same conditions as [Play](https://playframework.com/) and the Play team has had good results with their community process, it was a natural choice to do the same for Slick.

In addition to Chris and myself, the initial maintainers of Slick under the new process are:

- [Ashutosh Agarwal](https://github.com/Radsaggi) who worked on Slick as part of last year's Google Summer of Code
- [Pawel Batko](https://github.com/pbatko) of [VirtusLab](http://virtuslab.com/), maintainers of [Unicorn](https://github.com/VirtusLab/unicorn) and other Slick-based libraries
- [Sue Carter](https://github.com/smootoo), maintainer of the [FreeSlick](https://github.com/smootoo/freeslick) suite of drivers
- [Richard Dallaway](https://github.com/d6y), author of [Essential Slick](http://underscore.io/books/essential-slick/)
- [Minglei Tu](https://github.com/tminglei), creator of the [Slick extensions for PostgreSQL](https://github.com/tminglei/slick-pg/)
